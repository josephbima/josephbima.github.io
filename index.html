<h1> Tip: "fake it til you make it" refers to emotions, not skills/knowledge </h1>
	
<p> 
I occasionally see the advice "fake it 'til you make it" brought up in the context of being a junior developer and in relation to impostor syndrome. It has always bothered me for couple reasons:

If someone is worried about being an impostor, telling them to 'fake it' seems to be just adding to that pretty directly -- the very definition of an impostor is someone who fakes something.

In healthy environments, it is rather hard to fake skill or knowledge for very long. You'll run into problems delivering and ultimately end up in a conversation about performance.

However, I've recently realized the conditions under which that phrase make sense: When the 'it' you faking is your emotional state.

So for example, if you walk into an interview and inside you are feeling nervous but you use confident body language, that will make you feel more confident. That 'faking it' actually caused a change in the real situation.

In contrast, if you are working on a problem involving debugging some container setup and you try to "fake it" and act confidently in your knowledge and ability to solve the problem without help...that won't actually tell you anything about port forwarding or cgroups. Instead, when you start 'faking it', you'll feel like you have to go heads-down and do a bunch of research yourself in order to be able to live up to whatever you promised about your knowledge. This is the wrong thing to do and can lead you down a 4-day rabbit hole... which holds your team back.

How to approach situations where you feel tempted to fake knowledge or skill relies on a few things:

Know that confidence isn't about believing you are smart. Its about believing its okay to be ignorant. If you abstractly know this to be true but you still get butterflies in your stomach, that is okay and a good place to apply "fake it til you make it" until your intuition catches up with your logic.

Be in a team which allows you to have the psychological safety to admit a lack of knowledge. This is one of the most important things to judge a team on when you are interviewing. Building this trust is also one of the things important to do in 1-on-1s.

Have self-knowledge which close-to-correctly reflects your level of skill. If you don't know anything about webpack, you should want to believe that you don't know anything about webpack. If you know a sizable amount about webpack, you should want to believe that you are pretty good at working with webpack.

Be skillful in asking for help in a way that sets your answerer up for success. Be able to ask questions like "who is a good person to talk to about X?" or "what are the important things to focus on when learning about Y?" which let you guide your learning.

Your job as an engineer isn't to know all the things but to take responsibility for communicating about and negotiating for the resources you need. That way, your team lead can delegate something to you and walk away thinking "okay, that's being taken care of and I can worry about other things. If anything comes up, he'll let me know" Those resources can include guidance in planning something, time in your own roadmap to spend explicitly learning about something, or a half hour on someone's calendar to walk them through your plan and challenge assumptions you didn't realize you were making. Without the ability to be honest with yourself and your team about gaps in your knowledge, it is incredibly hard to work up the courage to ask. But with that self-knowledge and a healthy organization, it often only requires asking.
